Once, these halls rang with life, craft, and discovery. Now only stone remains — and memory.","What you see above is not all that was built. What you hear below is not truly silent.\n\nAtheris was carved into cliff and cavern to shelter a great truth: that power flows through the world in veins — through earth, flame, and silence.\n\nWe learned to draw from these forces. We learned too much.","At the city's heart lies the Great Hollow, a cavern torn open when the foundation failed. Within it rests the skull of a Dragon, left not as warning — but as consequence.\n\nThe Dragon was not slain here. It was bound elsewhere.","The scholars named the collapse The Shattering. The builders named it The Night of Falling Stone. The survivors called it Mercy.\n\nFor the city did not merely fall — it was sealed.\n\nA door was closed. A Veil was drawn.","The Veil separates our world from others. When the Veil weakens, echoes cross: violence, order, hunger, silence.\n\nThe place where all three echoes converge is known as the End.\n\nTo enter the End is to step beyond the balance of the world.","Beneath the Dragon's remains is a sealed gate, crafted by the last Archons of Atheris.\n\nThe gate does not open for one will alone. It demands offerings — materials bound to every realm.\n\nOnly when the city's heirs act in unison will the gate acknowledge their claim.","Two visions now rise from the ruins.\n\nOne seeks preservation — to restore balance, regrow the land, and prevent the errors of the past.\n\nThe other seeks dominion — to master the city's legacy and command the world through it.\n\nBoth believe themselves rightful heirs. The city listens to both.","Know this truth, traveler:\n\nThe End does not test strength alone.\n\nThose who breach the Veil will face not one trial, but three.\n\nFor the powers once divided now stand together beyond the gate.","The Dragon endures as the will of Silence, unchanging and eternal.\n\nThe Wither manifests the hunger of Flame, destruction without rest.\n\nThe Raidborn carry the persistence of Stone, marching until all resistance breaks.\n\nTo challenge the End is to challenge all three Crowns at once.","This is why the gate was sealed. This is why the Dragon remains. This is why Atheris fell.\n\nThe city could not survive a second awakening.\n\nWhether you can has yet to be written.","If you would reclaim this place, do so with eyes open and hands steady.\n\nExplore the ruins. Unearth the buried records. Forge alliances — or rivalries.\n\nEvery step taken here echoes beyond the Veil.","This record ends where your story begins.\n\nAtheris remembers those who move carefully. It rewards those who endure.\n\nAnd it punishes those who wake what should remain sleeping."]},enchantment_glint_override=true]
